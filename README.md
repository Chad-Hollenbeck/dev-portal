# My Dev Portal
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3 and uses **Angular 8.x Core**. The Admin template behind the UX design can be found here: [https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/appwork-bootstrap-4-template-ui-kit-WB0C668T3](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/appwork-bootstrap-4-template-ui-kit-WB0C668T3). This is by far the best Angular UX template I've used in my career and would highly recommend it!
